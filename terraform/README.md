## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Guide

### 1. Configure VMware Workstation REST API:
```powershell
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation"
vmrest.exe --config
```
### 2. Start VMware Workstation REST API
```powershell
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation"
vmrest.exe

### 3. Test the API (Optional but Recommended): Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8697` (or `https` if you've configured SSL, which is more complex to set up initially).

### 4. Open your Command Prompt/Terminal and navigate to your `my_vmws_terraform` directory:
```powershell	
cd C:\Users\Username\Terraform\my_vmws_terraform
```
### 5. Initialize Terraform:
```powershell	
terraform init
```
### 6. Plan Your Infrastructure Changes:
```powershell		
terraform plan
```
### 7. Apply the Infrastructure Changes:
